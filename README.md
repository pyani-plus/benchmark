# `benchmark`

`benchmark` is a helper package for [`pyani-plus`](https://github.com/pyani-plus/pyani-plus) that generates mock bacterial genome sequences with known pairwise sequence identities. It is intended for benchmarking the accuracy and precision of genome distance calculation/estimation tools, including `pyani-plus`.
